###### Hey, Welcome to my github page!
- Iâ€™m a machine learning scientist/engineer with extensive experience in computer vision and deep learning.  I have mainly worked on supervised and unsupervised information retrieval, image segmentation and classification. I implemented and evaluated several ML models in Python (PyTorch, Tensorflow, sklearn).
