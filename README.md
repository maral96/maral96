###### Hey, Welcome to my github page!
- I’m a machine learning scientist/engineer with extensive experience in applications of deep learning.  I have mainly worked on supervised and unsupervised information retrieval, image segmentation and classification tasks. I implemented and evaluated several ML models in Python (PyTorch, Tensorflow, sklearn).
